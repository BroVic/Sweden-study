"I have some issues with the data:
1. In some of the responses you have the option 'Don't Know/NA'. Which does one take and how do we deal with this in the analysis?
2. There no locational or jurisdictional data available and thus we have absolutely no clue where these data are coming from or whether they are clustered in one particular country or region to the disadvantage of others.
3. No information on data collection, which makes 2. above a real problem in terms of making inferences.
4. There is no information on the sampling method used, if at all or the inclusion criteria."
